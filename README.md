# Unit_2.2_Assignment

Please view the Sort_File file for programming code.

The purpose of this project was to use the same array data from Unit 2.1 Assignment and
sort and display the data using either the title of book in alphabetical order or based
on number of chapters.

Note: while sorting by chapter and separately by title works, would definitely have a need
to sort by chapter first, THEN also by title.
